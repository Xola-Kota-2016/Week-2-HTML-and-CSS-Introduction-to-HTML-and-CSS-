Notes on Week 2 HTML and CSS: Introduction HTML to CSS

5. HTML Working with Graphics and Images
   - To insert an image in HTML we use the img tag or element.
   - There are four attributes every image must have. The SRC attribute tells the browser which      image load.
   - The ALT attribute provides a text description of the image, lastly we have the width and height attributes, which determine the size of the image.
   -  The ALT attribute can act as an image replacement.
   -  It is important to include the width and height.
   -  It is best to use images with the smallest size but visually stunning images. This allows faster downloads and saves user data.
   -  There are four main image formats. PNG, GIF,JPEG and SVG.
   -  GIF: This format is good for compressing illustrations that have a large area of the same color.
      It falls short when it comes to photographs. It only supports 256 colors and images can look pixalated.
   -  SVG: This image format is best for logos, icons and other types of illustrations.
      It contains instructions for drawing rather than pixels. It can be scaled to any size without losing quality, the file remains small.
   -  JPG: This format is a popular choice for compressing photographs. large files can slow down the website loading time therefore it is best to compress the image
   -  PNG: This format is best for when you need transparency in your photograph, it sometimes outperforms GIF and JPG in compressing certain types of images.
   -  When working with image files consider the physical size, image format and compression settings.
   -  Use the srcset attribute to provide the browser with image options to improve loading time.
