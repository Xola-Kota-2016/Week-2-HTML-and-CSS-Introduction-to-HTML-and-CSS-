5. HTML Working with Graphics and Images
   - To insert an image in HTML we use the img tag or element.
   - There are four attributes every image must have. The SRC attribute tells the browser which      image load.
   - The ALT attribute provides a text description of the image, lastly we have the width and height attributes, which determine the size of the image.
   -  The ALT attribute can act as an image replacement.
   -  It is important to include the width and height.
